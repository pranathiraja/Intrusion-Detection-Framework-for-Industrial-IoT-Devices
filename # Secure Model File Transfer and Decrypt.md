# Secure Model File Transfer and Decryption

## Overview

This code establishes a secure connection between a server and multiple clients for the purpose of receiving, decrypting, and saving compressed model files. The server receives encrypted and compressed model files from clients, decrypts them using a generated key, and saves them locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Python 3 or higher
- The `tqdm` library for progress bars
- The `zlib` library for compression and decompression
- The `cryptography` library for encryption and decryption

## Code Explanation

### 1. Establishing a Secure Connection

```python
def connect_clients(connection, address):
    # Receive salt, client id, file size, ratio
    salt = connection.recv(16)
```

- The `connect_clients` function is the entry point for each client connection. It receives the client's salt, client ID, file size, and compression ratio.

### 2. Generating the Decryption Key

```python
    # Generate the key
    key = helper.generate_key(float(ratio), salt)
```

- The `generate_key` function (not shown in the provided code) generates a decryption key based on the client's compression ratio and salt.

### 3. Receiving the Encrypted Model File

```python
    # Receive the compressed and encrypted model file
    compressed_model = b''
    received_size = 0
    file_size = int(file_size)

    with tqdm(range(file_size), f"Receiving Client {client_id} model file", unit="B",
              unit_scale=True, unit_divisor=1024) as progress:
        recv_start = time.time()
        while received_size < file_size:
            data = connection.recv(16384)
            if not data:
                break
            compressed_model += data
            received_size += len(data)
            progress.update(len(data))
        progress.close()
        recv_end = time.time()
        print(f"Client {client_id} model file has been received, time spent: {recv_end - recv_start:.4f} seconds")
```

- The server enters a loop to receive
